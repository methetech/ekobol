            <p>
                At Ekobol, we believe that to truly reach the potential of e-commerce, business founders should focus on creating products, not managing the complexities of digital operations. This philosophy has led us to introduce the **Partner Plan**, our most comprehensive offering designed to empower both established brands and budding entrepreneurs.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the Partner Plan?</h2>
            <p>
                The Partner Plan is a unique partnership based on a simple profit-sharing model: **50/50**. While you produce and ship your amazing products, we manage every aspect of your digital presence and marketing efforts. This means you can scale your business without getting bogged down in juggling platforms or learning the intricacies of AI tools.
            </p>

            <h3>What's Included?</h3>
            <p>
                With the Partner Plan, Ekobol handles every detail of your digital business, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional Brand & Website Build:</strong> We create your brand identity and dedicated e-commerce website from the ground up.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Digital Marketing Management:</strong> We run all your marketing strategies, including SEO, paid ad campaigns, social media management, and content creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Operations Management:</strong> We handle day-to-day operations, including product listings, multi-marketplace synchronization, inventory automation, customer service, and marketplace support.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Why Choose the Partner Plan?</h2>
            <p>
                This plan is perfect for busy founders whose time or expertise is better spent on product development rather than tackling all aspects of digital marketing or platform management. With the Partner Plan, you get:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximum Growth, Minimum Effort:</strong> Leverage our expertise to expand your business, allowing you to focus on what you do best: innovation.</li>
